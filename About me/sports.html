<h1>My two favorite sports and two things I like about them...</h1>
<h2>Soccer</h2>

<ul>
    <li>Soccer seems like a cool sport to try out. </li>
    <li>For soccer you train mainly legs and core. Which I do regularly. </li>
</ul>
<h2>Track</h2>

<ul>
    <li>I like the idea of training to be very fast.</li>
    <li>Pushing myself to my limit or overcoming my limit excites me.</li>
</ul>
<p>But to be honest, I mainly like Track and Field because running relaxes my mind. But I also really like racing against people. Which shows my progress.</p>
